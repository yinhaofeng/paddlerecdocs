## Installation of Fleet-Lightning
To show how to setup distributed training with fleet, we introduce a small library call **fleet-lightning**. **fleet-lightning** helps industrial users to directly train a specific standard model such as Resnet50 without learning to write a Paddle Model.

``` bash
pip install fleet-lightning
```
